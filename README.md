# DMX512-Transmiter-and-reciver-Code
Dmx512 protocol is used to send PWM values of 512 channel in theater lightining control application. In this repository i am sharing with you the working simulation file of proteus and DMX512 Tranmsiter and reciver Code.
Transmiter Transmit the PWM channel values of 60 to 65 and Reciver recive these values and show on LCD and PIC hardware PWM module is used to get the Desired PWM.
